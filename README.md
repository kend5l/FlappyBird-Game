# FlappyBird-Game
I'm using this project to learn and refine my 2D game skills in java. This is very similar to the original flappy bird game but adding my own twist.

FEATURES TO BE ADDED:
1) Difficulty settings (DONE):
     A user may select difficulties ranging from easy, normal, and hard. Difficulty effects the distance between pipe openings.
2) High Score (DONE):
     After a game completes, the user sees their current score and their personal high score. If the user closes the session their high score is lost.
3) Theme selection:
     Users can customize their theme to fit their needs. background changes, bird changes, pipe changes.
